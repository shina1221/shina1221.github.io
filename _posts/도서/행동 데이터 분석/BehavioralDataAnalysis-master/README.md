# BehavioralDataAnalysis
Support files for the O'Reilly book "Behavioral Data Analysis with R and Python" by Florent Buisson.

If you encounter any problem with the code, please raise an issue through GitHub or email me at florent.buisson.oreilly@maskedmails.com, I'll do my best to address it. 

The code scripts for the chapters of the book are in their respective folders. The folder "Exercises and solutions" contains all the exercises for the book. The folder "production code" contains productionalized versions of the main custom functions I have created, which are more robust to errors (but still come as-is, with no guarantee whatsoever).

I'm not sure yet how much readers care about exercises, so I have created a limited number of them. Feel free to email me at the address above or raise a GitHub issue if you'd like more of them. 

**UPDATE Jan 7th 2023: one of the R packages used in the book is no longer available on CRAN. This has led me to finally get started on converting the code for the book into proper R and Python packages. Things will be a bit in flux until these are fully functional, apologies in advance.**

_For the time being:_
- _R users: please go to https://github.com/BehavioralDataAnalysis/R_package, where you'll find the work-in-progress version of the package._
- _Python users: for now, please continue to use the code in the present repo, given that nothing is broken at the moment, I'll let you know when to migrate._
